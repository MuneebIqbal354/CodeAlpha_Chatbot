<h1 align="center">Task No. 2: Chatbot</h1>

## Task Overview

This project implements a text-based chatbot capable of engaging in natural language conversations with users. The chatbot uses Ollama, a large language model (LLM), to generate human-like responses. This implementation is designed to showcase how conversational AI can be integrated into various systems to automate and streamline user interactions.

### Features:

- **Conversational AI:** The chatbot processes user inputs and generates appropriate responses using the Ollama LLM.
- **Scalability:** By using a large model, it can handle various types of queries and maintain meaningful conversations.
- **Ease of Deployment:** The chatbot can be set up and customized with minimal effort.

### Technology Stack:

- **Python:** The programming language used for implementing the chatbot.
- **Ollama LLM:** A language model with 8 billion parameters that powers the chatbot's conversational abilities.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Used for development and demonstration of the chatbot.

## Code Explanation

The chatbot code is structured into several key sections, each handling a different aspect of the implementation. Below is a detailed explanation of the key sections of the code:

### 1. Installing and Setting up the LLM

The first part of the notebook sets up the Ollama model, which is crucial for the chatbot's conversational capabilities. The shell script installs the necessary tools, and the model is pulled for usage.

**Key Steps:**

- Install Ollama via a shell script.
- Pull the desired model (Ollama 3, 8B parameters) for generating conversational responses.

```
./install_ollama.sh
ollama pull 3
```

### 2. Chatbot Model Setup

Once the model is downloaded, the next step is to initialize the chatbot by loading the model. This part of the code ensures the model is ready for inference (responding to user queries).

```
from ollama import OllamaModel

# Load the model
chatbot_model = OllamaModel(model_id="3")
```

### 3. User Interaction Loop

The chatbot operates in a loop where it continuously waits for user input, processes it, and generates a response. This section of the code is designed to handle real-time interaction, taking user queries, processing them with the model, and returning a generated response.

```
while True:
    user_input = input("You: ")
    if user_input.lower() == "quit":
        break

    # Generate response using the model
    response = chatbot_model.generate(user_input)
    print(f"Chatbot: {response}")
```

**Key components:**

- **Input handling:** Captures user input and waits for the next command.
- **Response generation:** Sends the userâ€™s query to the model and generates a text-based reply.
- **Termination:** Users can exit the loop by typing "quit".

### 4. Response Generation

The model processes the user's input and generates a response. This part of the code handles the interaction between the user input and the large language model. The generated response is based on the pre-trained parameters of the model and adapts to various questions and prompts.

```
def generate_response(input_text):
    # Generate a response using the model
    response = chatbot_model.generate(input_text)
    return response
```

### 5. Error Handling and Cleanup

To ensure smooth operation, the chatbot includes error handling and cleanup operations, allowing the system to gracefully exit or restart in case of unexpected issues. This also includes handling invalid inputs or unforeseen failures in generating responses.

```
try:
    # Main chatbot interaction loop
    start_chat()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    # Clean up any resources or close connections
    chatbot_model.close()
```

**Key components:**

- **Error handling:** Captures and logs any errors that occur during the interaction.
- **Cleanup:** Ensures the resources used by the chatbot (e.g., the language model) are properly closed or released after execution.

### Usage

Once the chatbot is running, it will interact with users through the command line or a user interface, responding to their input in real-time.

- Start a conversation: Simply type your questions or commands, and the chatbot will respond.
- Exit: Type `quit` to end the conversation.

Example:

```
You: Hello!
Chatbot: Hi! How can I assist you today?

You: What is the weather like?
Chatbot: I'm unable to check real-time weather, but you can visit your local weather website.

You: quit
```
